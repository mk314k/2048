# 2048

Welcome to the 2048 GitHub repository! This repository contains the source code and deployment configuration for the 2048 game, which can be played at [mk314k.github.io/2048/](https://mk314k.github.io/2048/).

The game is built using the following technologies:

- Vite: A fast build tooling framework for modern web projects.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

## How to Play

The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles to reach the 2048 tile. You can use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to move the tiles in the corresponding direction. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with double the value. After each move, a new tile will appear randomly on the board.
